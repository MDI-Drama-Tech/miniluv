        <p>Absolutely no livestream recordings will be kept after the show closes. Anything recorded by YouTube (the livestream service provider) will be deleted after the show closes. The livestream key generated by YouTube will be deleted after the show closes. The livestream feed itself will not be listed publicly on YouTube, and will only be accessible via this temporary website made expressly for this production of 1984. </p>
        <p>The areas which are being streamed for the preshow and intermissions are limited to the lowermost house right and left only. Seating in those sections is completely optional.</p>
        <p>The content of the livestream will only be used for the purposes of the show during which it is active, and for no other purpose. The livestream camera feed will not be active during the regular performance itself. Any camera feeds used during the showtime performance itself are not broadcast. The resolution and quality of the camera feed is deliberately low-quality. There is no audio from the cameras.</p>
